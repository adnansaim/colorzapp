ColorZapp is a color-generating web-based application built with Html Css and JavaScript

In this app, users can generate a random color by clicking "Generate Color," the color will be displayed in the box below the button.
Additionally, here in the RGB and HEX input fields, he/she can see that color's RGB and HEX values. The converted hex color is auto-generated. I have implemented a copy animation button beside each input field to ensure you have correctly copied the color code.

Also, a user can toggle the red, green, and blue values to adjust the color. The RGB and the hex values change over there.
If you change the text of the RGB input, the hex input changes, the color box appears, and the toggle bars change according to the input text given. The same goes for the hex input.

Lastly, this app has a dark mode option. If you click this button, the light and dark modes change.
That was all about my ColorZapp project. Thank you.
